          <div class="project-section-description">The 2016 election exposed a huge divide within America. This divide was accentuated because of a lack of understanding of other people's beliefs. Because people are so polarised, living together and trying to get things done together are much harder to accomplish.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">I decided to look at how current debates take place. I looked at two different scenarios, the first was how political debates are organized and the second was how high school debate club debates take place. The purpose of political debates is to expose the candidate's view and political objectives. The debates also take place with multiple people and cover many topics. High school debates, on the other hand, have two sides that debate a particular topic. Each side takes turns giving an argument. I'm more connected to the highschool experience and I think that the debate club format works better for organizing a debate on one particular topic between two people.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">There are almost 3.5 billion people that use social media.

          <div class="project-section-header">Hypothesis</div>
          <div class="project-section-description">I want to create an app that would find a way for the user to feel safe to open up and express their feelings as well as hear and understand the opinion of others. It would create a structured messaging experience that would enable people to understand others with opposing opinions to theirs.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">There would be many different topics that the users could have conversations about. The main ones would be topics relevant to that day’s news as well as topics that are suggested based on previous topics the user has shown interest in. From the main topics page, users would also be able to browse suggested categories for topics and featured questions. The user could also search for a topic they are interested in or search for another user such as one of their friends if they want to have a conversation with someone in particular. Even though the focus would be on topics that usually get people fired up, the app would try to encourage people to communicate in a more civil manner.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">While designing the Debate App, I tried to find a way to regulate the conversations and keep them civil. The first thought that came to mind was having moderators. This idea has been implemented on sites like reddit but require a lot of people to monitor the forums and are not always effective but I also wanted to give more than just a forum. I needed a solution that could be easily implemented without requiring a lot of personnel. If I used a simple messaging system then people could easily go on rants and interrupt and insult each other. I decided to turn the messaging into a debate club-like interface. Each user can type an opinion or response and then once they send it, they have to wait for the other person to reply before they can send something again. By using this type of communication, the users will formulate their responses and take time to think about what they are sending since they can only send one message at a time. This will hopefully aid in elevating the conversation and making it more thoughtful. Another issue of debating and having conversations through messages is that it is very hard to convey tone and emphasis. To solve this problem I decided to add the ability to record voice messages that you can send to the other person. The users can also easily insert links to articles to be able to back up their claims and opinions. All of these features are meant to help structure the conversations in an effort to teach people to express their opinions in a respectful manner.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">The app would only work if people are willing to be open. It only encourages people to be open and then tries to connect them with others. If people are unwilling to accept new ideas or unwilling to be open to changing their own then the app would fail completely at its objective.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section">
          <div class="project-section-header">Further Steps</div>
          <div class="project-section-description">I would want to find solutions to the limits of the app but on top of that, I need to figure out how to gain a user base. There needs to be enough users so that everyone has someone else to debate with. In order to start gaining user I need to start small. It could be used as a very interesting tool in classes. I would partner with another school somewhere else in the US and use the Debate App to have small conversations between their school and mine. From there, I would expand to other schools and hopefully build enough a a user base to be able to open the app to other people in the general public.</div>
