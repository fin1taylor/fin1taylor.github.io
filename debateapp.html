          <div class="project-section-description">One of the things that fascinates me about technology is how it can affect the way we communicate. I love debating with my friends and talking about current world events but I find that a lot of the time, we agree on topics like politics because we’ve grown up in similar environments. I wanted to find a way to debate with people who come from different backgrounds and have differing opinions.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">By connecting us, the internet gives us a great opportunity to understand and debate differing points of view. However, when I look at the current state of online communication, I find that discussions quickly devolve into insults, even over topics that are barely controversial. Politics, now more than ever, are dividing us; so I started to think of a way to use the immense benefits of the internet to enable civil conversations.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">I wanted to create an app that would allow for open communication and help people to be more understanding of each other. Before diving into designing the app, I needed to understand why it was so hard to have a civil online discussion. I found that people either see valid criticism as a personal attack or simply attack someone else personally for their opinion without making a well thought out argument. Personal attacks just end up making people even more blindly entrenched in their views.</div>
          <div class="project-section-description">As I started to think of ways to address these problems I looked into past presidential debates and researched guidelines for debate club debates to observe how they were organized. Based on what I learned, I was able to brainstorm solutions that could be implemented into the app.</div>

          <div class="project-section-header">Hypothesis</div>
          <div class="project-section-description">I realized that there are two key issues with online debates: the first is that people tend to not be open to new opinions; the second is that people tend to react with their emotions.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">There would be many different topics that the users could have conversations about. The main ones would be topics relevant to that day’s news as well as topics that are suggested based on previous topics the user has shown interest in. From the main topics page, users would also be able to browse suggested categories for topics and featured questions. The user could also search for a topic they are interested in or search for another user such as one of their friends if they want to have a conversation with someone in particular.</div>

          </picture>
          <div class="project-section-description">To solve the first obstacle and get people to open themselves up to the possibility of new ideas, the app randomly assigns people to one side of the debate. This forces people to look at the issue from a different perspective but also shifts the focus from attacking a particular person to looking objectively at the topic at hand. The second issue is addressed by allowing a user to send only one message at a time; once you’ve sent your argument, you have to wait for the person to reply before continuing. This gives each person the time to think about the topic so that they can elaborate a well thought out response instead of just reacting with their emotions. The structure of the app would force you to see where the other side was coming from, but also examine and question your own opinions.</div>

          <div class="project-section-header">Limits</div>
          <div class="project-section-description">The app would only work if people are willing to be open. It only encourages people to be open and then tries to connect them with others. If people are unwilling to accept new ideas or unwilling to be open to changing their own then the app would fail completely at its objective.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section">
          <div class="project-section-header">Further Steps</div>
          <div class="project-section-description">I would want to find solutions to the limits of the app but on top of that, I need to figure out how to gain a user base. There needs to be enough users so that everyone has someone else to debate with. In order to start gaining user I need to start small. It could be used as a very interesting tool in classes. I would partner with another school somewhere else in the US and use the Debate App to have small conversations between their school and mine. From there, I would expand to other schools and hopefully build enough a a user base to be able to open the app to other people in the general public.</div>
