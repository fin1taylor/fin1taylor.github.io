          <div class="project-section-description">Tailored is a mobile application designed to help tailor outfits out of the clothes you own and share them with friends. The goal of the application is to fight fast fashion that's overtaking the world right now and devastating for the environment. The app promotes reusing your clothes into awesome outfits that you can then share with your friends and see what their wearing for the day. I'm currently working with a friend to develop and launch the application.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">Our target demographic for the app is young adults and teens who are either getting into fashion or are already very into the fashion world and who not only want to show off their style but also catalog their outfits. They are on their phones a lot throughout the day and are very knowledgeable about many different forms of social media.</div>

            <div class="project-section-description">When first designing the Today Page, the daily outfit was directly incorporated and editable from that main page. This felt very cluttered and made the Today Page feel less concrete. I decided to make it a separate page that you could easily pop into from the main page but it now had the feeling of being very bare-bones with a lot of lacking features. Since this was the "Daily Fit" that would be recommended by the app, the general user would most likely want to heavily customize it. I settled on a page where that made it super easy to add and remove items as well as easily access the items already added. I also made it easy to share the daily fit and see when it's published since the app revolves around the idea of "share what you wear" on that specific day.</div>

            <div class="project-section-description">The Fits Page needed to catalog and sort all of the outfits users wanted to create. I started out by having all the user-created categories in a grid and I placed the category name above to allow users to differentiate between the categories and the actual clothing items (which you'll see down below). I still needed a way to differentiate them more so I added a cascading effect to the background to make it clear it's a grouping of many different things. The Public Fits category needed to be emphasized since it isn't just another basic category and the fits in there are public. I decided to highlight that category since it acts as the user's "profile" and have it occupy the two columns and emphasize that the other categories were private.</div>

            <div class="project-section-description">The original Wardrobe Page was just a huge grouping of all the clothing items and was mainly there as the page to add new items. I wanted to make the page into something that users would actually enjoy browsing and so I switched to using clothing categories inspired by the Fits Page but these categories would be basic and just help with finding specific items. I also modified the "enlarged fits page" to align with the look of the "Daily Fit".</div>

Users can browse through their clothes which are sorted by type and the when they click on a certain item they can see other similar items in their wardrobe or items that might go well with it.</div>
