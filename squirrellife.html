            <div class="project-section-description">For a computer science class I took at Georgia Tech, I was tasked with creating a game for the GameBoy Advanced. The game I ended up making was heavily inspired by Terraria. In this game you are a squirrel, just trying to go about life, climbing up trees and collecting nuts. As you progress through the game you can get more and more tools to interact more and more with your environment. The project was coded in C, entirely from scratch apart from a few files that dealt with communicating with the GBA hardware. I coded the game engine from scratch and created all the art for the game.
