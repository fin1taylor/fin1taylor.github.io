            <div class="project-section-description">Everytime that I would get onto a plane I would be annoyed by the experience of using the in-flight screens. With seemingly few necessary features, it seemed ridiculous that these airlines didn’t have a good user experience. It therefore became my goal to design an intuitive and simple interface for a screen on an airplane.

          <div class="project-section-header">Main Screen</div>

          </picture>
          <div class="project-section-description">My main goal was to cut down on the clutter and provide a clean interface. The map takes up the largest portion of the screen and immediately draws the users eyes in. It looks visually pleasing and adds some entertainment to a home screen that would otherwise be dull and serve the sole purpose of navigating users to other screens. Users now have a reason to stay on the homescreen and maybe keep the screen on even if they aren’t using it. Besides the map, I cut down the other features and accessible screens to entertainment: Movies, TV Shows, Music, and Games. The other content on this main screen is a flight “progress bar” at the bottom, the “on your flight to…” test at the top which personalities the experience and makes the users feel more welcome and quick stats on the time remaining and arrival time of the flight - the basic info people generally tend to care about the most.

          </picture>
          <div class="project-section-description">For the onboarding experience, the user must select their language (which by default would be the language of the country the flight was coming from) as well as select the content filters. Language is usually selected here at the start but I added these “content settings” in order to simplify the experience once users got into the main screen. By having users select their content settings during the onboarding it means that each entertainment page can be better tailored to the user and restrict access to certain content if needed.</div>

          <div class="project-section-description">The quick settings would be present at the top of every screen and would contain features that users would need quick access to such as volume and brightness control. When not on the main page, the quick settings would also include basic info on the remaining flight duration and easily access the map. Users would also be able to change their selected language from here, call a flight attendant for help and turn the screen off.</div>

            <div class="project-section-description">The map section opens up the map full-screen and displays more statistics about the flight than on the main screen. It still shows the time remaining and arrival time but now also gives the current time both for the departure city and the arrival city as well as give stats on the altitude, outside temp, and current speed, things I know I used to love to see and geek out over as a little kid. The main itself has three views, all of different framing and zoom levels which users can cycle through with the buttons on the bottom left.</div>

            </picture>
            <div class="project-section-description">The movies and other entertainment screens operate in a similar manner to each other. There is a dashboard with categories for the content to be sorted in and then easy access to the “saved” movies as well as seeing an overview for all categories. Each movie poster has a quick and easy way to save it. The categories would display all the movies it contains sorted by release date, relevance, or alphabetical order (whichever is more intuitive for the category).</div>
